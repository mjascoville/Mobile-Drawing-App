# Overview

Using my Kotlin code as a base, I have written a very basic Drawing App for use on Android mobile phones. This was done as a practical exercise to familiarize myself with the process of mobile development.

This app will allow users to draw images using lines and circles. The user interacts with the canvas through intuitive touch and drag motions, and can select which tool and color they want to draw with using the buttons found at the bottom of the screen. Lines are drawn from point to point, and circles are drawn based on the radius defined by the user.

While it is fun to mess around with drawing shapes, the main purpose for creating this app was to familiarize myself with Android app development, and specifically with using Android Studio. There were a lot of new skills I had to learn, and using this Kotlin code as a base was a great opportunity for me to better understand how these apps function.

Here is a link to a video demo of the program:

# Development Environment

This app was developed in Android Studio.

The program was written mainly in Kotlin, and I used xml to format the user interface.

# Future Work

Here is a list of things that can be done in the future to improve the app:
* Add an undo button. This should allow the user to remove the last shape added to the list.
* Add a saving feature. Save files locally on the phone to be loaded at a later date.
* Add a gallery feature to the landing page. This should allow the user to view previous saved works.
